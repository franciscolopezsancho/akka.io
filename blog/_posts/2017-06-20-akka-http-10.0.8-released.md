Dear hakkers,

We are proud to announce Akka Http 10.0.8, which is the eight release of the Akka Http 10.0 series. This is a regular 
maintenance release that contains several maintenance fixes, improvements and new features.

### Https Proxy Support

Long awaited support for configuring an HTTPS CONNECT Proxy (example for [Scala](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/client-side/client-transport.html?language=scala#use-https-proxy-with-http-singlerequest) and [Java](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/client-side/client-transport.html?language=java#use-https-proxy-with-http-get-singlerequest))
for the client has arrived. Thanks a lot, [Michal Sitko (@note)](https://github.com/note), who implemented the feature.

Support for proxies that require authentication is yet to be implemented and is tracked by the ticket [#1213](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1213).

### Ability to express textual content types with missing character set

Akka-http has a strongly typed media type / content type system, and knows at compile time about which media types
are supposed to express a character set attribute, e.g. `text/plain; charset=UTF-8`. Before this release, akka would
silently assume UTF-8 for `ContentType` instances of media types with a missing `charset` attribute.

From now on, content types missing a charset can be both parsed and expressed directly, using the new 
`ContentType.WithMissingCharset` trait/class. 

- For incoming Content-Type headers with values missing a charset, such as `text/plain`, the header 
  `ContentType` will be represented as `WithMissingCharset`, rather than assuming an UTF-8 charset 
  (which could have been a wrong guess).
- If you need to create such a content type programmatically, use e.g. ```MediaTypes.`text/plain`.withMissingCharset```
  (scala) or `MediaTypes.TEXT_PLAIN.toContentTypeWithMissingCharset()` (java).

*Note to scala users*: If you have `match` statements across `ContentType`, keep an eye out for new compiler hints. You need
to decide what what to do in case you get a content type with a missing character set, by adding a 
`ContentType.WithMissingCharset` case.

### Server-Sent Events Support

Support for Server-Sent events was added by merging akka-sse project by [@hseeberger](https://github.com/hseeberger). Thank you very much, Heiko!

### Notable improvements by module

#### akka-http-core

* HTTPS proxy support ([#192](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/192))
* Allow '=' in query param values in relaxed mode ([#1120](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1120))

#### akka-http

* Add support for Server-Sent Events ([#669](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/669))
* Add support for textual content types with missing character set ([#1134](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1134))

#### akka-http-testkit

* Remove unnecessary dependency to ScalaTest from JUnitSuiteLike ([#1147](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1147))

#### Documentation

* Document pluggable client transport infrastructure and HTTPS proxy support ([#192](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/192))
* Reference security announcements and release notes in ToC ([#1199](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1199))

### Bug fixes by module

#### akka-http-core

* Parse Websocket headers according to the set header processing mode ([#1166](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1166))
* Fix a regression which caused the idle-timeout on server side not to function properly ([#1012](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1012))
* Add a special handling of the charset parameter in Accept header when comparing media types ([#1139](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1139))
* Use ws(s) scheme instead of http(s) when calculating effective websocket request URIs ([#909](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/909))
