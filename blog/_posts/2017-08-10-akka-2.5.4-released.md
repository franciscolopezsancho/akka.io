Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. 

Users of akka-camel are recommended to update to Camel version 2.17.7 and akka-camel 2.5.4 due to a security vulnerability in Camel, see below.

Some notable improvements in 2.5.4 are:

* New [PartitionHub](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/stream/stream-dynamic.html?language=scala#using-the-partitionhub) for routing of elements to dynamic streams, [#21880](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21880)
* New [timer API](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/actors.html?language=scala#timers-scheduled-messages) for scheduling messages in an actor to itself, [#15733](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15733)
* New affinity dispatcher, thanks to [Zahari Dichev](https://github.com/zaharidichev) and Viktor Klang, [#12035](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/12035)
* Support more than one role in Cluster aware routers, thanks to [Sébastien Lorion](https://github.com/slorion), [#23257](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/23257)
* Prioritized merge stream operator, thanks to [Arpan Chaudhury](https://github.com/arpanchaudhury), [#22865](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/22865)
* Following the [Reactive Streams 1.0.1 release](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/update-release-reactive-streams-1-0-1-and-jdk9) yesterday, Akka Streams is now fully compatible with that revision of the standard (which is backwards compatible with 1.0.0)  [#23498](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/22865)
* Stages for [restarting streams after a backoff](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-error.html?language=scala#delayed-restarts-with-a-backoff-stage), thanks to [James Roper](https://github.com/jroper),  [#19950](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/19950)

A total of 53 issues were closed since 2.5.3. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.4](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/117?closed=1) milestone on github.

## Security vulnerability in Camel dependency

akka-camel had a dependency to camel-core 2.15.6 and that version of Camel’s Validation Component is vulnerable against SSRF via remote DTDs and XXE, as described in [CVE-2017-5643](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5643). Therefore we have updated the Camel dependency to version 2.17.7 in Akka 2.5.4 and 2.4.20. If you are using akka-camel you should also update your dependencies of other Camel modules to 2.17.7.

This update of Camel version might cause that akka-camel is not fully backwards compatible with prior versions. We didn’t have to change the source code when updating but there might be changes in Camel that we are not aware of. It’s recommended that you recompile and test your applications and libraries when doing this update.

We would like to thank Thomas Szymanski for bringing this issue to our attention.
