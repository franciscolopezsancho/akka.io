In today's blog post we want to highlight a specific new integration that has landed in Alpakka. Specifically, it allows you to seamlessly integrate with your `akka.stream.[javadsl|scaladsl].Source` types in your Spring Web applications, and have them be understood by Spring natively.

[Alpakka](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current), is our way of solving the *Reactive Enterprise Integration* problem. We do so by providing a collection of *streaming* plug-and-play connectors to various technologies. Today we'd like to highlight one specific integration, since it's the result of the [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org) initiative, which we were part of from its inception. And also explains what its [successful inclusion in the Java 9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html) means for the future of inter-operability of Reactive Streams based libraries.

On a related note, Akka Streams is one of the first libraries to provide native support for Java 9's `java.util.concurrent.Flow.*` (as of writing, Spring does not provide this support yet, while RxJava provides bridges separately packaged), so if you're looking for a future-ready Reactive Streams implementation, simply use Akka Streams `2.5.6+` and you're ready to go.

Let's focus on today's highlight though, the new Spring Web compatibility module:

### Using Akka Streams natively in Spring Web endpoints

Thanks to [Alpakka](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current)'s integration code (included since version `0.14`), you're now able to depend on the [akka-stream-alpakka-spring-web](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/spring-web.html) Alpakka module: 

```
// build.gradle
dependencies {
  compile group: 'com.lightbend.akka', name: 'akka-stream-alpakka-spring-web_2.12', version: "VERSION_HERE"
  // the latest version as of writing this blog post was 0.14, but please always include the latest version
}
```

And right away you're able to return Akka Streams in your Spring Web (thus also Spring Boot) endpoints, like this for example:

```
import akka.NotUsed;
import akka.stream.javadsl.Source;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class SampleController {

  @RequestMapping("/")
  public Source<String, NotUsed> index() {
    return
      Source.repeat("Hello world!")
        .intersperse("\n")
        .take(10);
  }

}
```

#### How does this work? Why is Reactive Streams important?

One may think that this integration was a lot of work, and in days before Reactive Streams that would have certainly been true. Now thankfully many major libraries provide support for Reactive Streams, which means that inter-op and the same semantics can be assumed from them.

In this case, since Akka Streams implement Reactive Streams, and Spring now provides a way to register Reactive Streams type adapters, libraries can use that to provide this inter-op very trivially â€“ by exposing their internal `Flow.Publisher`/`Flow.Subscriber` which then "just works". The same can be said about adapting other RS implementations to be used in Akka Streams - you can simply wrap them into a Source or Sink, perserving all RS semantics.

In this specific case, we implemented a so-called `ReactiveAdapter`, and handle all the configuration for you. While we think that the naming here is somewhat misleading, since [Reactive is a lot more](https://www.oreilly.com/content/why-reactive) than just the Reactive Streams interfaces (with which this Adapter works), however this pluggable architecture makes it nice for implementations to provide their own adapters. Spring's own Reactor, in fact, [uses](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/ac1d3b22c9d092cd7d093cca9bbe4feede134fca/spring-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/core/ReactiveAdapterRegistry.java#L240) this Adapter mechanism, so this indeed can be seen as completely "native" support.
