Dear hakkers,

After more than two months since Alpakka 1.0-M1, we are delighted to announce the second milestone release of Alpakka 1.0.

Highlights of the new release are:

 * new Akka Stream native [MQTT Streaming Connector](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/1.0-M2/mqtt-streaming.html) thanks to [@huntc](https://github.com/huntc), the existing Eclipse Paho-based connector will stay around for a while but might be discontinued in the future
 * new [Couchbase Connector](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/1.0-M2/couchbase.html) which even is the base for the new [Akka Persistence Couchbase](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-couchbase/current/), thanks to [@dannylesnik](https://github.com/dannylesnik) 
 * refactoring of the [S3 Connector](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/1.0-M2/s3.html)
 * refactoring of the [JMS Connector](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/1.0-M2/jms/index.html).
   Also support for retries and connection status thanks to [@andreas-schroeder](https://github.com/andreas-schroeder)
 * refactoring of the [Google Cloud Pub/Sub Connector](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/1.0-M2/google-cloud-pub-sub.html) thanks to [@tg44](https://github.com/tg44)
 
For detailed changes and credits take a look at the [release notes](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/release-notes/1.0.x.html) in the Alpakka documentation.

Even modules that have been changed to meet Alpakka 1.0 standards might get more API-breaking changes before Alpakka reaches 1.0. If you prefer adapting to these changes in one bigger step, keep the version you are using until Alpakka 1.0 is final.

Happy hakking!
